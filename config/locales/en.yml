              inline_help: Determine, wether this video is a mono- or stereoscopic 360° video. With the page type 360° video, interactive scenes can be built with it. Before uploading an option "Auto detect" can be chosen as well. This sets the value of square videos to "Equirectangular (stereo)", and videos with an aspect ratio of 2:1 to "Equirectangular (mono)".
              inline_help_disabled: Determine, wether this video is a mono- or stereoscopic 360° video. As soon as the video is processed and auto detect is completed, this setting can be edited again.

          text: "# 360° Video\n_Plays an interactive video, in which a user can look around._\n\nThe video must be created in “equirectangular-panoramic” format (see also [Wikpedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection)) \nYou can use monoscopic and stereoscopic videos:\n\n* Mono-videos must have an aspect ratio of 2:1 (e.g. 4096 x 2048).\n* Stereo-videos must have an aspect ratio of 1:1 (e.g. 4096 x 4096) where the two image areas are stacked above each other.\n\nThe suitable projection for the video can be chosen while uploading in the file settings. For videos, with the above aspect ratio the right projection is selected automatically.\nYou can then determine a specific video within the page settings by clicking the tab „Files“. \n\nWhen choosing the file only such files are being displayed that were marked as 360° video while uploading. If you forgot to determine a projection in the upload process, you can subsequently change that within the settings at any time. Simply click on „manage files“, search the list for that 360° video and click onto the gear icon.\n\nThe initial view angle can also be determined via the „files“ section in the page settings. By choosing the „autoplay“ option you can specify if a video starts immediately when the page is entered or if users shall start the video with a play button.  \n\nNote, that (partly) for technical reason an autoplay is not possible on mobile devices. The following browsers support playback of 360° videos:\n\n* Latest versions of Chrome and Firefox on OSX, Linux and Windows.\n* Latest versions of Safari on OSX.\n* Latest versions of Chrome on Android.\n* Latest versions of Internet Explorer 11 and Edge on Windows.\n\nFor not supported platforms, you can link to a Youtube version. The 360° video will then be displayed for iOS devices directly within the Youtube app. All general options for the appearance of a 360° video page, if 360° video playback is not supported, can be edited via the tab „Fallback“. Here you can also determine a text, to explain that a user’s browser cannot play the video.\nBy clicking the option „Fallback preview“, you can see in a preview how the page looks like for users if a browser doesn’t support 360° videos.\n\n "
